And then black night. That blackness was sublime.
 I felt distributed through space and time:
 One foot upon a mountaintop, one hand

 One ear in Italy, one eye in Spain,
 In caves, my blood, and in the stars, my brain.
 There were dull throbs in my Triassic; green
 Optical spots in Upper Pleistocene,
